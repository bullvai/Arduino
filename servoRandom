// the code on line 5 tells the software that we want to use the Servo library
#include <Servo.h>

// line 8 creates a Servo object using the Servo library
Servo servo;

// line 11 declares a variable. It's a number that we will use to tell our servo where to go
int targetPosition;


// in our setup function, we want to tell our board that our servo is connected to pin 2
// we only need to do this once, which is why it's in the setup function
void setup() {
  servo.attach(2);
}


// this is where the fun happens
void loop() { 
  // line 25 tells the computer to choose a random number between 0 and 180
  // we use this range because the servo can only move from 0° to 180°
  targetPosition = random(181);

  // line 28 tells the servo to go to the position we came up with from line 22
  servo.write(targetPosition);

  // line 32 tells the computer to wait for a random duration between 0.5 and 1.5 seconds
  // after this wait time expires, the loop will run again. This happens over and over... forever.
